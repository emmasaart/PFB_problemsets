Emma by Shel Silverstein

Emma loves me,
Emma cares,
Emma picks me peaches and pears.
Emma offers me candy and Cokes,
Emma listens and laughs at me jokes.
Emma helps when I get in a fight,
Emma does all my homework at night.
Emma misses me,
Emma cries,
Emma thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Emma is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Emma just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Emma's hand,
In the darkness where Emma usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Emma's gone!
